[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgeodesy.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "geodesy", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "geodesy" with any
  of the following names:

    geodesyConfig.cmake
    geodesy-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "geodesy" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "geodesy_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "geodesy" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
